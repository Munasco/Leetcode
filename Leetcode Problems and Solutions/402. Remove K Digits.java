/*
 *
 * Given a non-negative integer num represented as a string, remove k digits from the number so that the new number is the smallest possible.
 *
 * Note:
 * The length of num is less than 10002 and will be â‰¥ k.
 * The given num does not contain any leading zero.
 * Example 1:
 *
 * Input: num = "1432219", k = 3
 * Output: "1219"
 * Explanation: Remove the three digits 4, 3, and 2 to form the new number 1219 which is the smallest.
 * Example 2:
 *
 * Input: num = "10200", k = 1
 * Output: "200"
 * Explanation: Remove the leading 1 and the number is 200. Note that the output must not contain leading zeroes.
 * Example 3:
 *
 * Input: num = "10", k = 2
 * Output: "0"
 * Explanation: Remove all the digits from the number and it is left with nothing which is 0.
